"the food was quite average and took a really long time

price on menu was  for a mountain pizza but we got charged almost  the cashier came up with the excuse saying the menu was outdated",1
we basically took over the whole place with our hockey team they were great about the noise and all the kids,5
el lugar  cierra  antes  del horario  que aparece  aquí así que ven antes,1
first time there seems like a family owned business they were cheerful and friendly and im happy to have ordered the spaghetti garlicawesome i loved it try it for yourself,5
cashier girl was a little rude for no reason  but food was bomb i got the chicken alfredo pasta,4
the pizza was way too much cheese staff unfriendly,4
i ordered through the slice app and got a message saying the calzone was done i got there they still needed about  minutes i sat in the parking lot and went back the kooks on me come in and pulled my calzone out even though it was still white i ordered two extra size of meat sauce instead of taking my order out i ate in the restaurant and asked the chef if she was sure she gave me meat sauce she said yes i then asked her why theres no meat in it she says its pureed and you would not be able to see even any tiny specks of meat then i got to the end of my calzone and i had this overwhelming taste of mold in my mouth so my cook was a liar and might have been trying to kill me the help she had was great and kind ,1
meatball sandwich yes,5
love the pizza here i get it often have been coming here for more than  years and they never disappoint,5
under new ownership  unfortunately the pizza was better before  employees are nice though,3

best tasting pizza to go,5
it is interesting that the name of business is fast pizza delivery but they dont deliver,1
"the best highest quality pizza ingredients polite service  i recommend the family  topping wings and garlic bread  average delivery time in my experience is  minutes  try them out

fast pizza is a haven for pizza aficionados seeking quick delicious meals with a menu offering everything from classic pepperoni to gourmet specialties each pizza is freshly madetoorder with quality ingredients that ensure a perfect balance of flavors and textures they are able to customize any pizza you want i usually order an xl  double pepperoni and  combination since moving away i find myself yearning for fast pizza daily—not just for its amazing food but for the memories of shared meals with friends and moments of pure enjoyment its more than just pizza its a nostalgic experience that i dearly miss making fast pizza a cherished favorite wherever you are  i have tried every pizza place in my new neighborhood and is just left disapointed if you are lucky enough to live close do yourself a favor and enjoy life a little more by eating this food fit for a king,5
i use to work across the plaza at the sherwin williams location and every time i got a pizza here they were fast good quality and the owner was the nicest guy ever prices are fair honestly,5
fast delivery better than mt mikes ,5
"not fast but straight house salad—its the bomb order your favorite salad to complete
ca",4
been coming here for  years pizza is always on point great place,5
delivery service is always rude every time i deliver i live in the apartment complex so when they get here seconds after they’re rushing me to come downstairs no please nor a call five minutes  minutes ahead of time,1
lunch on  ordered a medium half buffalo mac and half banh mi staff was nice  toppings were ok but i wasnt a super big fan of the pizza base it tasted pretty bland and store bought,3
pretty much anything you get on the menu is delicious i had a great time and i would go back again everything on the menu is some kind of a pizza but it was all good,5
have a plan b i still like the place but it’s open intermittently,3
love there pizza please ship to pennsylvania smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes,5
"i paid sammy gs nearly  for catering lunch service for our employees about  people for the weeks leading up sergio the gm was extremely communicative i confirmed with him the day of the event that his team would arrive at am am turned into  which is when the event was supposed to start meanwhile sergio would not take my calls or reply to my emails and i received no update or explanation

when the team arrived they offered no apology for being late one team member and said they werent supposed to get there until  while another claimed they got stuck in traffic  pick a lie and stick with it they moved with zero urgency even after being told that the lunch event was delayed

to top off this disaster the pizza was awful it tasted like something youd get at a school cafeteria there was no salad dressing for the salad about half of the pizzas went uneaten and these people love to eat

i have not received any communication from sergio i too would like to pretend this never happened but unfortunately i had to spend the rest of my day apologizing to  people extremely disappointing experience",1
sorry guys the pizza just isnt very goodgreat for late night sjsu crowd that dont know any better face_with_rolling_eyes,2
"this place has the best wings in town large breaded and perfectly fried the mango habanero and buffalo are excellent great pizza pies reasonable beer selection and best happy hour prices on food and drink “everyday” get the tachoes for sure i’m only in town in the summer and this is my go to for sure great chill vibe
they deserve the business",5
great pizza spot  friendly staff and tasty pizza they have lots of good deals on weekday evenings and good happy hour selection,5
great pepperoni pizza deal on mondays quality pizza and selection of beer,5
i was pleasantly surprised at how good the tater tots were during happy hour great portion size for the price good to share with pesto chicken sandwich had a nice toasty bread bun got a good amount of chicken and the side of fries were nice and crispy,5
cool patio i wish they had more interesting local beers,4
the place is great pizzas are better i ordered farmers market and veggie deluxe pizzas both were delicious,5
the doobie brothers so totally rock,5
its a nice place to go after walking my dog at san jose state they have personal pizza and craft beers  they are dog friendly and my small dog can be free without a problem at the outdoor seating area which is fenced,4
order a pale ale guy serves me a hazy beer that isnt labeled as hazy on the beer list he argues with me instead of pouring a beer i want,2
if youre for delicious new york style pizza this is the place to go whether you dine inside or outside theres a lot of tvs to watch sports games in addition you have a wide range of beer selection on tap and in bottle cans this place is family friendly because i see a lot of families here and there was a little league baseball team celebrating outside as well however i do have two problems for one the main menu is high up on the wall close to the ceiling is really difficult to read especially if youre short secondly the caesar salad or garden fresh salad are for one person only under appetizers,4
chicken and garlic pizza and beer were wonderful,5
"bibo’s ny pizza – even doordash couldn’t ruin this one

alright so i took a gamble and ordered bibo’s ny pizza through doordash—usually a dangerous game because nothing ruins a good pizza like a delivery guy with a lead foot but folks let me tell ya “the goat” arrived looking and smelling like a masterpiece

bacon crispy goat cheese fancy but in a “this belongs on pizza” kinda way and that hot honey who knew sweet and spicy could work so well i took one bite and immediately questioned every plain cheese pizza i’ve ever ordered

even after the delivery detour the crust held up like a champ—just the right mix of chewy and crispy like it was engineered for greatness

bottom line if this pizza tastes this good delivered i can only imagine how good it is fresh bibo’s you’ve got yourself a lifelong fan  outta  dadapproved stars",5
just really good pizza,5
this is my absolute favorite pizza in san jose here’s the trick tho get a cheese pizza with extra tomato sauce and charred at the bottom extra crispy and you’ve got yourself the closest thing to an authentic brooklyn pizza they also have great beer and a great outdoor seating area,5
the best thing about this place is all of the flavours on the menu can be requested as a slice lots of vegetarian options,5
"really solid pizza is a top  or so in the bay area that ive tried
flavors are good and its very ny style

however sometimes it does char a bit too much for how this it is and is a bit iffy then

overall for price its just about average so worth a try for pizza fans",5
always the best pizza and beer in town,5
"bibos has a special place in my heart

i randomly came across them back in  when it was literally a hole in the wall at the corner of bird ave and west virginia st i got the pepperoni and a can of cactus cooler as my first meal there the owner made and served the pizza then and he makes and serves the pizza to this day over the years it has been a privilege to see and experience bibos growth and expansion and im so happy for them

for over a decade the quality of the food and the service has remained consistently amazing everyone in the joint is so hardworking and kind my goto pizzas remain the buffalo chicken and pesto fire they just have that flavor that hits the spot every time

when theyre busy the pizzas may take a while to get to you but i feel like its always worth it but just the fact that theyre so busy just shows that others love their pizzas as well

i always try to make time to visit them whenever im back in the bay i just love them that much pizza

thank you for the pizzas and hospitality bibos youre always a part of home ill be back soon smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes",5
best pizza place in sj the atmosphere is great and it feels like your with lots of locals the beer selection is pretty decent as well but can be to ipa heavy now the pizza is phenomenal and i prefer the combo white pie italian and mediterranean,5
awesome place for excellent pizza lots of great flavors of pizza to choose from staff is always very friendly and provides top notch service prices are more than reasonable great place to watch a niner game,5
some of the best pizza in all of san jose  i love the fact that you can just get whatever slice you want rather than the whole pizza  perfect for just a quick bite with family or friends and they have a ton of great beers on tap,5
we didnt get the pizza but we did get the ravioli with spicy vodka sauce it was absolutely delectable we met the owner and he was an absolute gem we love the location of little italy even though we got a  parking ticket ha ha pay attention to how long the parking lasts dont let this stop you as the food is unbelievable,5
"edit arrived home and found they gave me a cold brownie instead of the pizza slice i ordered crazy

placed an online order at  on the order it says will be ready at  arrived at the place on time and waited for another  mins got my order at  what’s worse is that some of the items are cold already ",1
"wow these pizzas are incredible they serve pizza by the slice so we tried four varieties veggie mediterranean corn  cilantro and a classic cheese slice every single one was delicious with a thin crust just the way i like it the toppings were fresh and the flavor combinations were spot on

the first bite of the cheese slice was pure nostalgia instantly taking me back to the streets of nyc  imagine the classic cent slice but elevated to a whole new level the slices are generously sized and i can’t wait to explore more flavors

that said my husband found the mediterranean pizza a bit too salty personally i could enjoy a single slice of it but a whole pizza might be a bit overwhelming",5
our first time getting a pizza here  it was great,5
go to food friendly folks,4
good artisan woodfired thincrust pizza that hits the spot with a drink we love their joes special and diavolo when available food comes out fast and the ingredient quality is fresh and great they also have a little bar seating area boxes are available for takeout,5
the service provided by mathew ethan and alex was beyond amazing not only are they attentive they provide service with a smile which was refreshing especially since we were visiting from sacramento,5
delicious i got the lunch special,5
"its alright i wouldnt get it over most pizza places i goto though

pricing isnt great but its ok too
overall i dont hate it but it was a try it once spot",3
stopped by here today for a late lunch im in san jose for a conference this weekend and decided to walk up to the san pedro square market there were a number of interesting food vendors in the market but i decided to check out pizza bocca lupo the guys were very friendly and recommended the lunch special my lunch special was a half of a joes pizza and a half salad they did not skimp on any of the ingredients the salad included arugula gorgonzola dried cranberries and a balsamic vinaigrette dressing the joes pizza included mushrooms and sausage all of the ingredients were topnotch and it was all done in less than  minutes i couldnt ask for anything better for a quick lunch all of that and the total including a diet coke was less than  including a tip these guys know what theyre doing definitely check them out,5
really great margherita pizza thin full of flavor and hot right out of the wood oven,5
ordered joes special and loved it flavorful toppings and great crust was worried it will get cold because it was a take out but it was still great,5
ive never seen a pizza like this before in my life where the hell did the half go it was my first pizza in america and i think itll be remembered as the worst pizza ever thank you,1
great pizza,5
it was one of the best pizza i ever had,5
even after going to italy a few times and having high pizza standards this place is very good fantastic margherita,5
best pizza in dtsj,5
the best pizza place in the bay area that combines quality with price delicious,5
essendo una pizza americana very good,5
"不難吃，但可惜披薩火候不夠，同樣的價格，我在sf可以吃到更好的

服務人員態度好",3
amazing food wait was longer than other places but the food makes up for it,5
already loved blue line pizza  now that its at the tank im thrilled hasnt been a good pizza option since round table left so this is awesome great regular pizza and their deep dish is out of this world go sharks,5
cool sj local spot the calzones are really good,5
"everything here is phenomenal  yes its a little on the pricier side but its sooo worth it

the customer service is phenomenal you can tell they really and actually care about both their customers and product and it shows

the pizza itself is delicious the crust is delicious crispy sourdough and the toppings are fresh and high quality the wings are plump and well cooked

we usually do take out and the food is always well packed and tastes incredible

the last round tavern is definitely in my top  for pizza joints in san jose if not the bay area

ps theyre sandwiches are also bomb i really wished i worked near the area so i could get it for lunch more",5
pizza looks good but i was hoping to get those classic rectangular slices that tavernstyle pizza is known for,4
great vibes in this nice little place and a solid cobb salad served quickly ill be back,5
la pizza deliciosa y las alitas de pollo las mejores,5
small place  about  table seats and  bar seats  beer taps full bar and a nice menu focusing on pizza locally owned with a light boxing theme mostly in the pictures on the wall i only had a beer this visit  but the pizza meatballs and wings looked and smelled really good,4
quality over quantity every time the last round is a breath of fresh air in a crowded pizza market they consistently deliver a toptier experience from the staff to the food if you want bready soccer pizza this one ain’t for you however if you want fresh ingredients that you can taste – this is the spot their classic margherita is done really well while the sob and spicy pono are solid choices ,5
its not new haven pizza but its pretty good best pizza ive had in the south bay,5
met the owner and his father very hospitable and friendly the service was on point and the chorizo pizza was bar none some of the best i’ve ever had the beer pizza and service make this place the best  punch combo around,5
great place to relax and eat some fresh sourdough pizza,5
brisket pizza simply the best pizza  that ive had in a very very long time  the service is great definitely a new regular stop,5
small and quaint i love that it’s local by cool person and excellent people work there had a marvelous lunch on thursday when they had their special chicken parmesan sandwich on freshly baked bread with a homemade tomato sauce beer drinkers would love this place too because they have a great selection of craft beers but also have a awesome selection sodas,5
delicious sourdough cheesless pie the tavern punch is a great way to celebrate the end of another week its not a bad walk from campus either i will definitely be back,5
there pizza is healthy and makes my stomach feel great unlike most places,5
"the pizza here is to die for honestly it is actual pizza most of the places in san jose dont serve pizza  the other places serve semi melted piles of cheap preshredded cheese ontop of a doughy mess

last round tavern makes a thin pie they get a nice crispy char on the bottom always within seconds of being over cooked they time the thing perfectly the cheese is melted to where it expresses its flavor beautifully they seem to always time and layout toppings so the pizza doesnt drown in the moisture the sauce is perfect

seriously probably the best pie you can get in downtown i noticed when you do only half toppings on a a pie they only charge you half price for those toppings holy crap what a nice concept so now when my wife want to engineer some pineapple infested pie i dont have to pay for a whole pie of pineapple thank god seriously knowing this now we are gonna build some serious bstrd pies

i have one observation a few weeks ago we got a personal sized pizza and the crust  edges were very different than what you get when you order a large so my advice is if you want the best pie get the large and just take the rest home and freeze it the ratio on the sizes below large were really really odd when it came to the dough  if you are going on a dave portnoy scale these guys are a solid  on the large pie and probably a  on the small

very similar to chicago tavern pie super thin with the square slices

i would love to see these guys attempt a south coast of boston bar pie because i bet they could do a hell of a job on that as well

wife and i like to stop in here after a bike ride or late at night around pm and sneak a pie on the patio and watch the craziness that is santa clara street at night time

looking forward to coming on day at lunch time and trying their sandwiches i bet they can make a serious blt",5
great food great people,5
great food and service the guy that seems to own the place is in there grinding and making great stuff best pizza in the south bay by a mile,5
food is amazing and service is always exceptional,5
great value substantial pizzas,5
the woman who worked there did not care to listen to what i was actually ordering gave me a wrong order and then blamed me for her mistake then she just took off the wrong toppings and gave me back the same pizza i am a vegetarian and the pizza she gave me initially was pepperoni,1
"stopped by mountain mike’s in blossom hill with the family for pizza night and it did not disappoint we’ve been to other mountain mike’s locations but this one is familyowned and the staff here is absolutely the sweetest plus the pizza solid the cheese pull was epic

we ordered a mushroom and olive pizza that was absolutely loaded with toppings on the side we added honey garlic wings and garlic knots—clearly we trying to make any new friends

while we waited the kids had a blast in the arcade there’s one by the entrance and another toward the back of the building such a fun touch to keep everyone entertained

when the food arrived the pizza was piping hot the wings were perfectly sticky and flavorful and everything tasted amazing it was a super satisfying meal from start to finish

bonus they have tons of parking and a lovely patio for outdoor dining when the weather warms up highly recommend this spot for your next pizza night—great food great vibe and great people",5
me gustó la comida pero sin embargo no había maíz de topping y en otros restaurantes de competencia si tienen mi opinión es que agreguen topping de maíz hundred_points por otro lado no en todas las mesas tenían los ingredientes extras que se le echan a tu plato,4
no tenían maíz y yo quería pizza de queso y maíz por lo menos estaba rika,3
if you order a halfhalf pizza they will charge you for the total number of toppings maybe this is a shortcoming in the software paying for four toppings on a medium pizza brings the price to almost  i could eat the whole pie myself it is not large it’s the thick grocery store frozen pizza style crust not handmade the location was  miles away and it took an hour and ten minutes for the food to arrive i don’t think i’ll order again,2
buffett was good,5
"excellent service by this guy
we ask jassi specially to make pizza for us
and this guy gives us a great service",5
great place,4
excellent service and nice staff  especially jassi is a great guy  his way of dealing is amazing,5
excellent service and nice staff  especially jassi is great guy and his dealing is awesome,5
don’t go for the lunch buffet paying  dollars for the experience of eating luke warm pizza and a salad bar from the ’s is just a rip off since many people don’t go to the buffet you are stuck with  of  choices of pizzas  being entirely made up of old combined pizzas  cheese and  supremepepperoni pizzait’s a complete disappointment,1
we had an amazing experience at this location went there with family the service was spot on if the staff is supportive like these were if you are out with family that’s all you need cashier jassi and server kavya were very generous and hospitable thankyou guys if you reading this hundred_points,5
against my will we ordered the burrata pizza i didn’t expect to like it but it was unbelievably good  great beers on tap too service was great,5
horrible experience i literally paid  for a medium pizza expecting large for a combination that they barely gave me any toppings on the pizza first  last time i will ever order from here sucks because i wanted to like them,2
pleasant atmosphere and good service but the burratapepperoni pizza was out right terrible the pizza was very doughy not remotely  wood fired crisp and the pepperoni tasted like a plant based substitute with no spice so so burrata the romaine side salad was fair good enough ingredients but overly bitter dressing for my taste i am ok with a living wage surcharge if the food is good but in this case it just added insult to overall terrible food,2
top tier food amazing atmosphere great service definitely recommend thursday night lasagna,5
my favorite pizza spot but they have great pasta as well  friendly staff and clean tables,5
tasty  creative food love their rotating beer list they always keep a good variety,5
the place is spacious easy parking clean and friendly service but the food was mediocre at best nothing we ate was bad but it wasnt very good either pizza wasnt as hot as something fresh out of a wood fire should be chicken wings were very plain not enough flavor the beef short ribs were tender but flavor profile wasnt intense at all overall like i said we came hungry and left full i was in the area so i thought to check them out since their menu is halal now but i wouldnt go out of my way to eat here either,3
muy buen lugar estábamos buscando un lugar así de comida con pizza y me sorprendió muchísimo y el sabor increíble saludos desde méxico Mexico,5
"pizza was sooo fresh and tasty

update
food was good hostess really sweet our server really disappointed us at this visit im certain she purposely kept ignoring us all we wanted was chili flakes she made us wait ten minutes kept doing stuff around us for other tables going to the back and front several times but not getting us any chili flakes finally i had to get up myself and get them from the kitchen pass she did a similar thing when it was time for the check and we had to ask the hostess for help and then walked over to the cash register ourselves to pay this is not how she was treating other tables not sure what she didnt like about us in particular
wont come here again as we felt very unwelcome",5
i celebrated my daughters birthday at willow street and everyone loved the food the garlic bread was my favorite and the service was excellent  definitely coming back,5
good food and good service was able to get the gnocchi with vodka sauce instead of pesto and was really good  the italian pizza is the way to go if youre wanting a pie  check out the special events  kids eat free on tuesdays wine wednesdays and more  parking and traffic can be tough on busy nights so be prepared if going on a weekend,5
wonderful mini designer pizzas and pastas the calamari appetizer was excellent we loved the hot bread with olive oil and garlic,5
ben was amazing we love his energy and he was very polite that being said the food itself was really disappointing and we have been coming here for  years the brussel sprouts were soggy slimy and oily the spinach dip tasted like eggs we held out hope for the main dishes but the pizzas let us down yet again we ordered bbq chicken pizza which had undercooked chicken and a burrata pizza which was covered in arugula and had practically no flavor it’s a real shame because we loved this restaurant but unfortunately the menu has changed significantly and the quality has declined we will not be returning to this location,1
best masala fries in the bay area,5
the flavor combinations that masala pizza has is so mind blowing the first time you try it my husband and i came back  times within the last few weeks i had to share the flavors with family and friends,5
the chicken tikka masala was absolutely delicious it was perfectly spiced tender chicken in a rich creamy sauce the customer service was exceptional with friendly and attentive staff making the experience even more enjoyable highly recommend,5
"edit
the manager politely promised to address the genuine concern updated my rating from  will update again once delivered

original
no doubt the pizzas are delicious but the staff made false promise to reward loyal customer

even after connecting with their support  leadership team i didnt receive closure

i wouldnt go back to a disrespectful eatery",4
i have never been but love the vibe,5
omg the pizza was so good i had to order a second one to take home with me make sure to order the chicken tikila and the wings and the loaded fries,5
"a midnight feast that changed everything
it all started at  am—the kind of hour where hunger doesn’t whisper it roars i was standing at the crossroads of discipline and indulgence torn between my commitment to fitness and the irresistible pull of a latenight masterpiece masala pizza’s chicken tikka pizza

i told myself just two slices a test of willpower a challenge to my selfcontrol but what i didn’t realize was that those two slices weren’t just food—they were an experience

the arrival of greatness
the moment i cracked open the box i was hit with an aroma so divine it was practically holy—a fusion of charred smoky tikka spice the richness of melting cheese and the unmistakable warmth of freshly baked naan yes you read that right this wasn’t just a pizza crust—this was naan bread cooked to golden crispy perfection its edges kissed by fire with just the right amount of chew

and then came the toppings

fire authentic tikka sauce bold and tangy coating every inch like a sacred marinade
hot_pepper crisp bell peppers  onions sliced to perfection adding a crunch that cut through the richness like a symphony of textures
cheese_wedge cheese  moti stretching oozing melding into the tikka sauce like a flawless duet
herb cilantro lime drizzle a burst of zesty freshness pulling everything together with a vibrant citrusy kick

and to top it all off a side of garlic aioli a sauce so smooth so garlicky that it should be illegal

the first bite – a moment of truth
i lifted my first slice the naan had that perfect crispness—the kind where the bottom is firm but the inside remains pillowy soft absorbing just enough sauce without getting soggy the cheese stretched as i took a bite and that’s when i knew

this wasn’t just pizza this was art

the smokiness of the tikka sauce danced with the richness of the cheese while the cilantrolime drizzle cut through like a burst of freshness resetting my palate for the next bite the balance of flavors was so precise so deliberate it was clear that this pizza wasn’t made—it was engineered

the battle of selfcontrol
i finished my second slice my body demanded more my soul demanded more but i had made a pact with myself—i was on a fitness journey and i was going to practice moderation

so with every ounce of restraint i closed the box the remaining two slices stared at me calling my name whispering promises of flavor yet to be explored

but i walked away

the morning after – a miracle unfolds
i woke up the next morning bracing myself for the damage but then—a miracle

yesterday i was  lbs

this morning  lbs

i had eaten pizza—real flavorful indulgent pizza—and still lost weight why because this wasn’t your average greasy gutbusting regretinducing slice no—masala pizza was portioned to perfection every bite was satisfying every ingredient crafted with intention making sure i got the full experience without overindulgence

the verdict
masala pizza isn’t just food it’s an adventure a journey of flavors textures and indulgence wrapped in just the right amount of discipline it’s proof that you don’t have to sacrifice taste for fitness—you just have to eat the right pizza

and if you haven’t tried it yet you’re missing out on one of life’s greatest culinary experiences

since pizza costs between  and  ill give it a solid  it may seem pricey but if youre searching for something delicious and fresh this place has everything you need the pizza was also freshly made which tastes better than other pizzas ive had the staff members there are also really nice,5
lan the owner of this place is so kind and thoughtfuland makes the pizza ever ,5
i love fast pizza,5
"excellent holeinthewall hangout

great potato skins and excellent service  hole in the wall type of location but welcoming and good food in an informal setting,4
didnt get the servers name but she was wonderful great experience,5
good food in a secluded location in an industrial area definitely off the beaten path but very friendly staff and patrons,5
cozy sports bar with good food and great service was perfect for our family dinner with kids,4
good food beers darts and pool whats not to love,5
i usually come in to pickup food  great food large quantities friendly staff  all good,5
"oneyear update upgrade my rating now one of my goto places for lunch forget the pizza still not that good but over the last few weeks i have gone in a few more times good burgers and chicken dishes reasonably priced online ordering is working now

atmosphere is still good ol california sports bar but a good place to drop in and pick up some lunch

lets just say i was not impressed order online doesnt work online menu doesnt work so i drove over anyway menu wasnt impressive pizza was greeeasy but fairly cheap for a pizza

might be nice for somebody looking for a dive bar with a couple of big tvs one with espn and the other with some infomercial for a steam mop but if youre looking for a reasonably priced lunch go elsewhere

you need to be open for lunch again",4
went during a weekday with coworkers and the foodservice was excellent great pricing with the quality of the food will be returning again,5
literally undercooked pizza raw dough frozen cheese cold everything except for some crust worst pizza of my friends entire life,1
not eatable payed  for this,1
"first time here ordered a hawaii and a dessert strawberry  chocolate pizza to go from the kiosk wait time until my pizza were ready was also reasonable around mn

they make the pizza front of you so thats great because you can actually see whats going on with your food however about exactly that the guy making the pizza uses his bare hands to prepare them i could have been ok with that since they are cooked afterward anyway but i saw him handling cash and then returning right away to prepare the pizza so thats not super hygienic

on the top of that once arrived at home i found out that their paper which they place under the pizza while in its cardboard box was totally stuck to it  it was impossible to remove the pizza from its box without destroying everything in the process so something to keep in mind if you order one to go there

fyi for two pizza with extra cheese  tip  taxes  ",3
this thing was several times bigger than my face  perfect temperaturecrispflavor love to see cutting fresh strawberries to make it happen,5
"horrible i paid  for a medium pizza and two sparkling waters she forgot the water so i ended up driving to get them and i paid delivery save your money
prices are way too high for what you get
the sparkling water was  bucks a tiny bottle",1
the ordering kiosk worked fine asked us to tip for water though and the food was ready pretty quick we ordered the hawaiian but there was barely any ham or tomato sauce and way too much cheese that tasted cheap the pineapple was also pretty bad very overpriced since a  dollar pizza could maybe be enough for one person but definitely not enough for two and even water is  bucks but i suppose thats regular prices for this area the dude working the register was nice,2
amazing pizza  smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes great service plus fresh produce everything about this place is unbelievable birria pizza and al pastor is top tier  very different unique flavors it’s delicious definitely a must to stop and try you won’t regret it thumbs_up,5
awesome pizzas al pastor is a favorite,5
birra pizza let me tell you it’s definitely delicious must it  the pizza dough is super soft and the crust is just perfect the meat is super flavorful you even get a side of the birria broth to dip the pizza in   you can either go with your traditional pizza or spice it up with a mexican touch definitely recommend this place ,5
i went there with my kids and they loved it so much this is authentic wood fire pizza the crust is nice and thin but not too crispy literally made to perfection  high quality ingredients and freshly made to order,5
"good unique modern pizza
carnitas   al pastor my favorite",5
honestly the best pizza ever and not to mention the way i get to add my favorite ingredients or try something different in a pizza style don’t think twice and stop by to try it is the best  you won’t regret it ,5
best pizza ever  the birria pizza was amazing  don’t be afraid to try something new you never know you might just fall in love with it just like we did  staff was great as well going back to try the rest for sure ,5
the guys here were so friendly not to mention the amazing pizza we got the birria carnitas and ricotta pizzas the birria and carnitas were so delicious ricotta was good and probably would have appreciated it more if the other two werent so delicious highly recommend trying these thinner crust pizzas,5
this place has got to be the best pizza place i have ever had a pizza where you can actually taste the flavor a pizza where they actually care about their customers and the customers need  stars only because google doesn’t let me put more i highly highly recommend this place if you are looking for some really good and tasty pizza,5
great pizza and great service,5
went downhill over the past  years and its just really ghetto if youre looking for a bunch of rowdy drinkers who will probably stab you this is a spot,1
i want to slap every person who recommended this place to me just tried it for the first time gross gave me and my daughter diarrhea dont eat here,1
"we walked in and the place did not smell like a pizza restaurant it smelled of cleaning solution
pizza is good the pepperoni needs to be chopped up more didnt care for the big chunks  as they were not very appetizing
got order to go was given just enough plates for the greasiness of the pizza would have preferred extra plates its common sense
atmosphere was same old looking place from years ago
arcade area was getting remodeled",4
pizza烤的不錯，可能語言有代溝吧，最後才發現雞翅膀沒點到。小費基本不用給，沒什麼服務,4
heard about this san jose favorite from friends so had to see for self not too busy on a saturday at lunchtime plenty of parking and tables available ordered the linguisa sandwich hawaiian pizza and a pepperoni service was great welcoming and friendly food was just ok nothing stood out bar was busy and restaurant got busy shortly after arriving will have to ask friends what the hype is all about been there since  wouldnt mind returning with recommendations,4
i love there wings,5
havent been there in many years still really awesome pizza,5
i went to the front counter to see if i can get my pizza boxed but when i asked for help he ignored me and kept walking but a nice lady that works there came right away with a smile and helped me ive going there since i was  years old love the place but you cant really say every restaurant is perfect had a food experience besides that one guy ill definitely keep going,5
lately the pizzas are very bad full of giant bubbles poorly counted the customer service is very bad if it is home delivery they arrive around  hour cold with hard cheese and the service that the indians do in this branch is terrible i do not recommend it,1
scheduled order did not work in this store staff was not friendly to deal with their miss pizza came with less portion of cheese and toppings,1
good option to buy cheese pizza,4
"didnt get any pizza ironically but there other offers are pretty good especially with the cost of fast food these days

the sandwich was probably the weakest out of the three but still was fine for its price",5
almost i added toppings to my pizza and there are only when i opened it most of my toppings were missing and when my husband tried to pay with card the employee ask him for cash and my husband said don’t have any cash and he asks my husband to search for cash in car and when my husband says no he started asking to do zelle for no reason,1
"this ones for all you pizza lovers going on right nownote this is only going on at the  berryessa rd suite  locationand you have to order on linebut the deal is you can order any crust any toppings sml size for  total is like now that being said the guy that runs the oven isnt a very into his job kinda guythe problem is he doesnt keep an eye on the pizza and result being you end up with huge spots on your pizza with no toppings just crust and that disappointed_faceand although i havent been charged extra yet but supposably there is a limit on toppings and this special ends on  so pizza out dude and dont forget the beer
late",3
the worst dominos in my nearby area today they got our order wrong and didn’t include half of the toppings ordered and didn’t add any extra toppings indicated in addition the pizza was overcooked we thought we’d try this place again because of a possible consistency issue but it’s clear now that it’s a recurring issue we will not be back,1
advertising any extra toppings pizza  i gave it a tried too good to be true each slice of pizza has one slice of jalapeno pepper one slice of pepperonis and couple olive rings didnt have any tomatoes sauce its the worse pizza i ever have very deceiving fool me once shame on you,1
said they delivered my order but did not then won’t answer the phone when i am calling the rest us rant to figure out what’s going on,1
ordered a pizza today it was flat and cheese just came off the dough i asked for red flakes he said no tight away i said huh the little packets he was like no you did not order when you ordered i was confused then he say’s you have to oay  for this pulls out a little small can of it … ummm what so the pizza is flat no flakes … never coming back back in the day it was not like this i do not know what happened,1
i generally order online and pick up i like the price and taste of their pizzas sometimes they get the order wrong though,3
app took the order and showed prepared and ready for pick up but shop is not open,1
really good new york style pizza which happens to be my favorite and restaurant had a cool s vibe which i really liked,5
awesome place and pizza,5
great pizza place with fair prices,5
"very cool pizza spot i think the cheese was better than the pepperoni and its a little expensive a slice but overall decent

there are many different options as well as vegan slices so a major plus to me i also recommend there cinnamon bread pizza thing cannot recall the name",4
i dined out the pizza was delicious although i would like not so soft it is difficult to eat when it folds in itself the attendants were super friendly,4
love the pizza after a hard practice this is the place to hit up pizza is great served hot with tons of ranch  a slice thin crust lots of toppings enjoyed there is a line for service when the place gets busy homeless people near the street so a little bit worried,5
"a great pizza place with some really good beer loved the pitchers of blood orange beer they had  great pizza and great garlic bread stick stuff too

very friendly staff as well  great pizza by the spice but they were running a one topping pizza special that night which was very nice was good for our table  the slices are huge

yum be nice if they were down in florida",5
perfect for late night pizza cravings,5
no custom topings,4
pizza is always amazing,5
solid pizza both the ny and detroit slices are really good they throw them back in the oven for a few minutes so you get that crispy under carriage the only complaint i have is the lack of cleanliness of the place trash and dirt is everywhere and the tables are sticky nauseated_face,3
i had the new yorkstyle margherita pizza and it was fantastic the crust was soft and pliable on the inside with a nice crispy edge the sauce had the perfect balance of tanginess making each bite delicious overall i was completely satisfied with the pizza,5
i ordered the spicy d with olive oil freshly grated cheese and hot honey drizzle the pizza came loaded with pepperoni veggies cheese topped with pizza sauce and red peppers the crust was crunchy on the outside and airy on the inside the dough had a savory flavor to it the pizza sauce on top helped cut out the saltiness from all the topping and the sweetness of the tomatoes helped balance all the flavor love the hint of herbs that were used the toppings all worked really well together i added the hot honey for extra it gave the pizza an extra layer of flavor sweet heat this time around i got the detroit style i will definitely be back to try the other styles of pizzas new york and sicilian,4
fantastic i don’t usually like detroit style all that much but theirs is really good topped with olive oil fresh parm and fresh basil chefs kiss,5
"the pizza was okay nothing special the service was fine but when i asked for peppers the guy just told me i could grab some from the table or get togo peppers since i had a togo order i asked for the togo ones and he seemed kinda annoyed when handing them to me—even though that should be common sense

i also mentioned that my family doesn’t eat pork and usually gets chicken or garlic pizzas but he told me chicken is the only topping they don’t have which was a letdown personally i eat anything that tastes good also they don’t have regular garlic bread only cheese garlic bread",3
i wanted to like soh so bad but unfortunately it didnt meet our expectations first i ordered for pick up and it was smooth for the most part but i made the mistake of not checking our pizza before leaving i came home and our pizza was burnt it wasnt even like a good char as you can see in the picture it was really just burnt i shouldve taken a picture under our pizza but it was also extremely soggy that i couldnt lift it up without it breaking the middle pieces were the most soggy the contrast between the soggy middle and the rock hard crusts really threw me off we got the post street hoping it might compare to prince street pizzas spicy vodka pizza but unfortunately the flavor was lacking and didnt blow our minds i wish i could give soh another chance but for the amount theyre charging for a pizza and even a slice i cant bring myself to it,1
wearing no gloves while touching cooked food about to be served is nasty,1
awesome style of pizza and delicious,5
one of best pizzas i have eaten in bay area,5
amazing deep dish  ill tell you about the thin crust when i can finally find a time i dont want to eat the deep dish  very fun small  nonchain place with great energy really good things cooking people who want to work there and thus a constant stream of people coming in,5
awesome and friendly staff great tasting pizza and presentation is always great smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes,5
if you are prepared to spend an outrageous amount of money on the best pizza in all of san jose go here,5
i placed my order for a pizza that wasn’t ready made the cashier said it’d be  mins and she’ll ring us up when it’s ready  mins past nothing yet we ask them what’s happening they tell us that order “didnt make it to them” once we voiced our complaints about waiting  mins for nothing the cashier who is now a different person tells us we’re harassing them and it’s not their problem then the cashier that supposedly took our order comes out we say that she took our order they ask if we paid and we say no she said she’d charge us one it’s ready just to be clear it was me and a friend that ordered  slices each of the detroit vs everyone we were both told it’d be a  min wait and we’d be charged when it was ready terrible service don’t even bother they take no accountability for their faults we waited  mins just for them to tell us that it’s our fault,1
"on january th at  pm i visited the restaurant with three friends each placing separate orders i ordered three slices of pizza while a friend ordered two the staff member at the counter informed us that our food would take about  minutes to prepare and we agreed to that timeframe knowing we would be charged upon completion

however after some time two of our orders were brought out and the staff again inquired about the remaining order we confirmed our order and they reassured us it would be ready soon as closing time approached at  pm a staff member informed us that they were closing we expressed that we were still waiting for our order but they responded with confusion stating they had no record of our order and that the kitchen was now closed

it felt intentional for them to wait until closing time to inform us of the kitchens status as regular customers who often enjoy their offerings we were disappointed with this experience especially given the premium prices due to this extremely poor customer service we have decided not to return",1
solid pizza slices super good crispy crust good flavor  per slice kinda pricey heavy on the toppings good ranch definitely recommend smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes,5
