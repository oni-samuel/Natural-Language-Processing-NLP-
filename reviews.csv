With a menu offering everything from classic pepperoni to gourmet specialties, each pizza is freshly made-to-order with quality ingredients that ensure a perfect balance of flavors and textures. They are able to customize any pizza you want I usually order an XL 75% double pepperoni and 25% combination. Since moving away, I find myself yearning for Fast Pizza daily—not just for its amazing food, but for the memories of shared meals with friends and moments of pure enjoyment. It's more than just pizza; it's a nostalgic experience that I dearly miss, making Fast Pizza a cherished favorite wherever you are.  I have tried every pizza place in my new neighborhood and is just left disapointed.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURIbDZLeTlnRRAB,"I paid Sammy G's nearly $4,000 for catering lunch service for our employees, about 300 people. For the weeks leading up, Sergio, the GM, was extremely communicative. I confirmed with him the day of the event that his team would arrive at 11am. 11am turned into 11:30, which is when the event was supposed to start. Meanwhile, Sergio would not take my calls or reply to my emails, and I received no update or explanation.

When the team arrived they offered no apology for being late (one team member and said they weren't supposed to get there until 11:30, while another claimed they got stuck in traffic - pick a lie and stick with it). They moved with zero urgency, even after being told that the lunch event was delayed.

To top off this disaster, the pizza was awful. It tasted like something you'd get at a school cafeteria. There was no salad dressing for the salad. About half of the pizzas went uneaten, and these people LOVE to eat.

I have not received any communication from Sergio. I too would like to pretend this never happened, but unfortunately I had to spend the rest of my day apologizing to 300 people. Extremely disappointing experience.",1,2024-09-20T17:27:39.574Z,1726853259,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURIbDZLeTlnRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x40770d0240a78a21!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDHl6Ky9gE%7CCgwIi-G2twYQ4PaDkgI%7C?hl=en,,en,0,109993158330886639844,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109993158330886639844?hl=en,Savannah Johnson,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWvSAeUFC9aBtcu1dFaNR90FkpCqK4_kFvp8vvAATLgIN0L8goi=s120-c-rp-mo-br100,1.0,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109993158330886639844/reviews?hl=en,,,Google,1.0,1.0,Delivery,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alright, so I took a gamble and ordered Bibo’s NY Pizza through DoorDash—usually a dangerous game because nothing ruins a good pizza like a delivery guy with a lead foot. But folks, let me tell ya, “The Goat” arrived looking and smelling like a masterpiece.

Bacon? Crispy. Goat cheese? Fancy but in a “this belongs on pizza” kinda way. And that hot honey? Who knew sweet and spicy could work so well? I took one bite and immediately questioned every plain cheese pizza I’ve ever ordered.

Even after the delivery detour, the crust held up like a champ—just the right mix of chewy and crispy, like it was engineered for greatness.

Bottom line? If this pizza tastes this good delivered, I can only imagine how good it is fresh.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNfNi02S3R3RRAB,"Bibo's has a special place in my heart.

I randomly came across them back in 2010 when it was literally a hole in the wall at the corner of Bird Ave and West Virginia St. I got the pepperoni and a can of Cactus Cooler as my first meal there. The owner made and served the pizza then, and he makes and serves the pizza to this day. Over the years, it has been a privilege to see and experience Bibo's growth and expansion and I'm so happy for them.

For over a decade the quality of the food and the service has remained consistently amazing. Everyone in the joint is so hardworking and kind. My go-to pizzas remain the Buffalo Chicken and Pesto 🔥 they just have that flavor that hits the spot every time.

When they're busy, the pizzas may take a while to get to you, but I feel like it's always worth it. But just the fact that they're so busy just shows that others love their pizzas as well.

I always try to make time to visit them whenever I'm back in the Bay. I just love them that much 🍕

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN2b18ydnRBRRAB,"Wow, these pizzas are incredible! They serve pizza by the slice, so we tried four varieties: Veggie, Mediterranean, Corn + Cilantro, and a classic Cheese slice. Every single one was delicious, with a thin crust just the way I like it. The toppings were fresh, and the flavor combinations were spot on.

The first bite of the cheese slice was pure nostalgia, instantly taking me back to the streets of NYC - imagine the classic 99-cent slice, but elevated to a whole new level. The slices are generously sized, and I can’t wait to explore more flavors.

That said, my husband found the Mediterranean pizza a bit too salty.

My lunch special was a half of a Joe's Pizza and a half salad. They did not skimp on any of the ingredients. The salad included arugula, Gorgonzola, dried cranberries, and a balsamic vinaigrette dressing. The Joe's Pizza included mushrooms and sausage. All of the ingredients were top-notch and it was all done in less than 5 minutes. I couldn't ask for anything better for a quick lunch.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNIczZqLWtnRRAB,"The pizza here is to die for, honestly it is actual pizza. Most of the places in San Jose don't serve pizza,  the other places serve semi melted piles of cheap pre-shredded cheese ontop of a doughy mess.

Last Round Tavern makes a thin pie, they get a nice crispy char on the bottom, always within seconds of being over cooked. They time the thing perfectly. The cheese is melted to where it expresses it's flavor beautifully, they seem to always time and layout toppings so the pizza doesn't drown in the moisture. The sauce is perfect.

Seriously probably the best pie you can get in downtown. I noticed when you do only half toppings on a a pie, they only charge you half price for those toppings. HOLY CRAP. What a nice concept. So now when my wife want to engineer some pineapple infested pie, I don't have to pay for a whole pie of pineapple. Thank god. Seriously knowing this now, we are gonna build some serious b@st@rd pies.

I have one observation, a few weeks ago we got a personal sized pizza and the crust / edges were very different than what you get when you order a large. So my advice is, if you want the best pie, get the large, and just take the rest home and freeze it. The ratio on the sizes below large were really really odd when it came to the dough.  If you are going on a Dave Portnoy scale, these guys are a solid 8.5 on the large pie, and probably a 6.7 on the small.

Very similar to chicago tavern pie, super thin with the square slices.

I would love to see these guys attempt a south coast of boston bar pie, because I bet they could do a hell of a job on that as well.

Wife and I like to stop in here after a bike ride or late at night around 9pm and sneak a pie on the patio and watch the craziness that is santa clara street at night time.

Looking forward to coming on day at lunch time and trying their sandwiches. I bet they can make a serious BLT.",5,2024-09-08T15:25:08.833Z,1725809108,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNIczZqLWtnRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x56eb626247bb497b!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICHs6j-kgE%7CCgwI1IP3tgYQyJTWjQM%7C?hl=en,,en,0,108032293447442317157,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108032293447442317157?hl=en,nextdoorwarren,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWH2vcS9G-DSG09u8ju8c-yECn3MauB-b2hfmd9MSsAoCdM4JU=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100,23.0,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108032293447442317157/reviews?hl=en,5.0,,Google,5.0,5.0,Dine in,Dinner,,4.0,$10–20,"Margherita,Signature Pizzas,Margherita Pizza",,,,,,,,,,

We’ve been to other Mountain Mike’s locations, but this one is family-owned, and the staff here is absolutely the sweetest. Plus, the pizza? Solid. The cheese pull was epic!

We ordered a mushroom and olive pizza that was absolutely loaded with toppings. On the side, we added honey garlic wings and garlic knots—clearly, we trying to make any new friends!

While we waited, the kids had a blast in the arcade (there’s one by the entrance and another toward the back of the building). Such a fun touch to keep everyone entertained!

When the food arrived, the pizza was piping hot, the wings were perfectly sticky and flavorful, and everything tasted amazing. It was a super satisfying meal from start to finish.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNBNlpDa19nRRAB,"Pleasant atmosphere and good service, but the burrata-pepperoni pizza was out right terrible. The pizza was very doughy (not remotely  wood fired crisp), and the pepperoni tasted like a plant based substitute with no spice. So, so burrata. The romaine side salad was fair, good enough ingredients, but overly bitter dressing for my taste. I am ok with a living wage surcharge if the food is good, but in this case it just added insult to overall terrible food.",2,2025-02-02T04:19:38.614Z,1738469978,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNBNlpDa19nRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xe0080892f46b0ff6!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgMCA6ZCk_gE%7CCgwI2uT7vAYQsPn4pAI%7C?hl=en,,en,0,117016908249682145448,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117016908249682145448?hl=en,Chris Dier,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVU5Rr5eGYtchgMrQxGo0hHJD_Uw-dNAvPUeH5OcGlskE-aKzs=s120-c-rp-mo-br100,6.0,2025-02-03T22:21:45.000Z,1738621305.0,"Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us, Chris.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURvdG9LMV93RRAB,"Pizza was sooo fresh and tasty!

Update:
Food was good. Hostess really sweet. Our server really disappointed us at this visit. I'm certain she purposely kept ignoring us. All we wanted was chili flakes, she made us wait ten minutes, kept doing stuff around us for other tables, going to the back and front several times, but not getting us any chili flakes. Finally I had to get up myself and get them from the kitchen pass. She did a similar thing when it was time for the check, and we had to ask the hostess for help and then walked over to the cash register ourselves to pay. This is not how she was treating other tables. Not sure what she didn't like about us in particular.

The Brussel sprouts were soggy, slimy, and oily. The spinach dip tasted like eggs. We held out hope for the main dishes but the pizzas let us down yet again. We ordered BBQ Chicken Pizza which had undercooked chicken and a Burrata Pizza which was covered in arugula and had practically no flavor. It’s a real shame because we loved this restaurant but unfortunately the menu has changed significantly and the quality has declined.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNBOUtMOG1nRRAB,"A Midnight Feast That Changed Everything
It all started at 12:30 AM—the kind of hour where hunger doesn’t whisper, it roars. I was standing at the crossroads of discipline and indulgence, torn between my commitment to fitness and the irresistible pull of a late-night masterpiece: Masala Pizza’s Chicken Tikka Pizza.

I told myself, Just two slices. A test of willpower. A challenge to my self-control. But what I didn’t realize was that those two slices weren’t just food—they were an experience.

The Arrival of Greatness
The moment I cracked open the box, I was hit with an aroma so divine, it was practically holy—a fusion of charred, smoky tikka spice, the richness of melting cheese, and the unmistakable warmth of freshly baked naan. Yes, you read that right. This wasn’t just a pizza crust—this was naan bread, cooked to golden, crispy perfection, its edges kissed by fire, with just the right amount of chew.

And then came the toppings:

🔥 Authentic tikka sauce, bold and tangy, coating every inch like a sacred marinade.
🌶️ Crisp bell peppers & onions, sliced to perfection, adding a crunch that cut through the richness like a symphony of textures.
🧀 Cheese & moti, stretching, oozing, melding into the tikka sauce like a flawless duet.
🌿 Cilantro lime drizzle, a burst of zesty freshness, pulling everything together with a vibrant, citrusy kick.

And to top it all off? A side of garlic aioli. A sauce so smooth, so garlicky, that it should be illegal.

The First Bite – A Moment of Truth
I lifted my first slice. The naan had that perfect crispness—the kind where the bottom is firm, but the inside remains pillowy soft, absorbing just enough sauce without getting soggy. The cheese stretched as I took a bite, and that’s when I knew:

This wasn’t just pizza. This was art.

The smokiness of the tikka sauce danced with the richness of the cheese, while the cilantro-lime drizzle cut through like a burst of freshness, resetting my palate for the next bite. The balance of flavors was so precise, so deliberate, it was clear that this pizza wasn’t made—it was engineered.

The Battle of Self-Control
I finished my second slice. My body demanded more. My soul demanded more. But I had made a pact with myself—I was on a fitness journey, and I was going to practice moderation.

So, with every ounce of restraint, I closed the box. The remaining two slices stared at me, calling my name, whispering promises of flavor yet to be explored.

But I walked away.

The Morning After – A Miracle Unfolds
I woke up the next morning, bracing myself for the damage. But then—a miracle.

Yesterday, I was 170.1 lbs.

This morning? 168.5 lbs.

I had eaten pizza—real, flavorful, indulgent pizza—and still lost weight. Why? Because this wasn’t your average greasy, gut-busting, regret-inducing slice. No—Masala Pizza was portioned to perfection. Every bite was satisfying, every ingredient crafted with intention, making sure I got the full experience without overindulgence.

The Verdict
Masala Pizza isn’t just food. It’s an adventure. A journey of flavors, textures, and indulgence wrapped in just the right amount of discipline. It’s proof that you don’t have to sacrifice taste for fitness—you just have to eat the right pizza.

And if you haven’t tried it yet? You’re missing out on one of life’s greatest culinary experiences.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtXzZ6V2FREAE,"One-year update. Upgrade my rating. Now one of my go-to places for lunch. Forget the pizza, still not that good. But, over the last few weeks I have gone in a few more times. Good burgers and chicken dishes, reasonably priced. On-line ordering is working now.

Atmosphere is still good ol' California sports bar, but a good place to drop in and pick up some lunch.

Let's just say I was not impressed. Order Online doesn't work, online menu doesn't work, so I drove over anyway. Menu wasn't impressive, pizza was greeeasy (but fairly cheap for a pizza).

Might be nice for somebody looking for a dive bar with a couple of big TVs (one with ESPN and the other with some infomercial for a steam mop), but if you're looking for a reasonably priced lunch, go elsewhere.

You need to be open for lunch again.",4,2022-11-17T20:46:42.695Z,1668718002,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtXzZ6V2FREAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x8e215c8b9fddf2a4!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIC-_6zWaQ%7CCgwImrajtgYQ0O3cwAI%7C?hl=en,,en,0,112657546277694402290,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112657546277694402290?hl=en,Bob Wall,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVMnn-fkGtaoqqpBjTf8eKzcNH60Lazbbdoe_yfSLmmwTHY-EO-=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100,11.0,2024-01-19T01:27:34.000Z,1705627654.0,Bob we are glad you found entrees that you enjoy!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNONW9ILUdnEAE,"First time here. Ordered a Hawaii and a dessert strawberry & chocolate pizza to go from the kiosk. Wait time until my pizza were ready was also reasonable (around 15mn).

They make the pizza front of you, so that's great, because you can actually see what's going on with your food. However, about exactly that, the guy making the pizza uses his bare hands to prepare them. I could have been OK with that since they are cooked afterward anyway, BUT I saw him handling cash, and then returning right away to prepare the pizza. So, that's not super hygienic.

On the top of that, once arrived at home I found out that their paper which they place under the pizza while in its cardboard box, was totally stuck to it ! It was impossible to remove the pizza from its box without destroying everything in the process. So, something to keep in mind if you order one to go there.

FYI: For two pizza (with extra cheese) + tip + taxes = $43.45",3,2024-01-14T06:12:13.675Z,1705212733,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNONW9ILUdnEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x8d9e63f6a1c8fec9!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICN5oH-Gg%7CCgwIvfaNrQYQqKmCwgI%7C?hl=en,"['https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJJmBwNUPw3xVJdnq8LMw5QNrcLYW9S8SiM5IOpsVylAtdS7oRGR_t205ur5Z984CGgPg1Ikg97GeALYRzw4qCeQ9ta_hz9X7o8NHKa4TP98IGeSohtvFfrV8Wq8h48KjNVX1jXI', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJKENbdBg1BBI9gQDZyPTFuEEJf4lQ30YAnrmtDY5W7xG5JonU5S6ddQfrtJkHPRJljCZZUl_JD_YYZgXUsKBFun0k55yBYmPPGoSsVTube2p4-yDpB4ziD_ykSO66xArQXQgwg', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJKvsycgOgCYJJgyAEVONVFf8-KwTt3MnOWqr76iuv0STPnoATSXPGmGA_4Lk1UxJ9btF9hLwvXmMncKx2zyI7lLhm8XV5AdnqCwt47grUqJtTYnNuZSy5MHxhAHhhhxiXH3Qw8T', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJLq2zdiHC_5zMcxAqEKmjsUN6_9wZaYSgjHYWeNAtKE-trnWSffQE4ZzkGcNucY28aZuFQ4mGdtOyfHy3Vm2Rb9IgM1rwu6AIaqt97G-diTtjqT_Vlsb6_SDIlExsTyMapBZ0w', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AIHozJIYgpViQk8pJKYtR9SGmMC1SlZHSaFi8W-JyUp3Dv8JdyUeNHeJEhWo0gz40Ki0Sdnr0aLMzZO2x_8TyZxyVyT8KunQbG3dHM2AGPWI94acD_sYBp0QMeN-ShJaM3KiVO9mxwlt7w']",en,0,102799107414532464427,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102799107414532464427?hl=en,Frank Sanchez,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUZjsWV692Aqc9srQLJz4NraLkxS0PEHLUROCa3eeMEkxh0baFd=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100,143.0,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102799107414532464427/reviews?hl=en,7.0,,Google,3.0,4.0,Take out,Dinner,,3.0,$30–50,,,,,,,,,,,

We ordered the Hawaiian but there was barely any ham or tomato sauce and way too much cheese that tasted cheap. The pineapple was also pretty bad. Very overpriced since a 20 dollar pizza could maybe be enough for one person but definitely not enough for two and even water is 3.5 bucks but I suppose that's regular prices for this area.

And this special ends on 3/2/2025 so pizza out dude and don't forget the beer.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNReE9QYTl3RRAB,"I ordered the Spicy D with olive oil, freshly grated cheese, and hot honey drizzle. The pizza came loaded with pepperoni, veggies, cheese, topped with pizza sauce and red peppers. The crust was crunchy on the outside and airy on the inside. The dough had a savory flavor to it. The pizza sauce on top helped cut out the saltiness from all the topping, and the sweetness of the tomatoes helped balance all the flavor. Love the hint of herbs that were used. The toppings all worked really well together, I added the hot honey for extra, it gave the pizza an extra layer of flavor sweet heat.

I also mentioned that my family doesn’t eat pork and usually gets chicken or garlic pizzas, but he told me chicken is the only topping they don’t have, which was a letdown.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNneE1peG9RRRAB,"I wanted to like SOH so bad, but unfortunately it didn't meet our expectations. First, I ordered for pick up and it was smooth for the most part, but I made the mistake of not checking our pizza before leaving. I came home and our pizza was BURNT. It wasn't even like a good char, as you can see in the picture.. it was really just Burnt. I should've taken a picture under our pizza, but it was also extremely soggy that I couldn't lift it up without it breaking. The middle pieces were the most soggy. The contrast between the soggy middle and the rock hard crusts really threw me off. We got the Post Street, hoping it might compare to Prince Street Pizza's spicy vodka pizza, but unfortunately the flavor was lacking and didn't blow our minds.

Then the cashier that supposedly took our order comes out, we say that she took our order. They ask if we paid and we say no, she said she’d charge us one it’s ready.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURfeTluTDlRRRAB,"On January 26th at 7:25 PM, I visited the restaurant with three friends, each placing separate orders. I ordered three slices of pizza, while a friend ordered two. The staff member at the counter informed us that our food would take about 15 minutes to prepare, and we agreed to that timeframe, knowing we would be charged upon completion.

However, after some time, two of our orders were brought out, and the staff again inquired about the remaining order. We confirmed our order, and they reassured us it would be ready soon. As closing time approached at 8 PM, a staff member informed us that they were closing. We expressed that we were still waiting for our order, but they responded with confusion, stating they had no record of our order and that the kitchen was now closed.

It felt intentional for them to wait until closing time to inform us of the kitchen's status. As regular customers who often enjoy their offerings, we were disappointed with this experience, especially given the premium prices.
